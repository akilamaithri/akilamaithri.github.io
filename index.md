- Hi, I'm a Research Assistant at the [University of Colombo School of Computing](https://ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/), actively looking for higher studies opportunities. (Here's my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJ8QoJpzDV0izujdDpfMvUbd72Hq-0oc/view?usp=sharing)) <br><br>
- Currently, I help my lecturers and undergraduates with exciting projects, such as finding ways to optimize bird sound identification, helping visually impaired individuals recognize local food on their plates, and developing an app that generates street view images for a synchronized dataset by capturing a vehicle's journey.<br><br>
- In my free time I listen to The Rolling Stones, watch a cool film or play American Truck Simulator on PC.
