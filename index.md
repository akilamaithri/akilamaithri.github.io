- Hi, I'm a Research Assistant at the [University of Colombo School of Computing](https://ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/), actively looking for higher studies opportunities. (Here's my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJ8QoJpzDV0izujdDpfMvUbd72Hq-0oc/view?usp=sharing))
- Currently help my lecutures and undergraduates with exciting projects, such as finding ways to optimize bird sound identification, helping visually impaired individuals recognize local food on their plates, and developing an app that generates street view images for a synchronized dataset by capturing the journey of a vehicle.
- In my free time I listen to The Rolling Stones, watch a cool film or play American Truck Simulator on PC.
