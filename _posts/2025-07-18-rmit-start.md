Started the next big—if not the biggest—project of my life: a PhD. Under the supervision of Prof. Ibrahim Khalil, I'll be working on a 'privacy-preserving framework for Large Language Models (LLMs)'. Or at least, that's the idea for now.

Moved to Melbourne in the first week of this month. After settling in, formal intros, and all the prerequisites, I'm back at it—continuing the adaptive DP projects I started in Sri Lanka.

Fingers crossed.
