## 6th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCEMENTS IN COMPUTING

(https://icac.lk/)

### Keynote Speakers

1. Prof. William Wong
   - He explored how visibility and cognitive design are important in making user-centered systems. He talked about Don Norman’s ideas and The Psychology of Everyday Things. He showed how too many layers of abstraction make things harder to use, like trying to tie shoelaces with chopsticks. He also explained how semantic mapping and reasoning can help make sense of things better.
2. Assoc. Prof. Nalin Arachchilage
   - He explained why privacy engineering is important and talked about different methods used to address privacy concerns. He mentioned a paper called Will They Use It or Not? that looks into privacy methodologies. He also shared how a serious game was created to teach privacy concepts and presented a framework that incorporates these ideas into gamification scenarios.
3. Dr. Nickson M. Karie
   - He talked about privacy trends and their economic impact, focusing on how AI-driven innovation connects with human potential. He shared a case study about an LLM log analyzer architecture to show how AI, innovation, and privacy intersect.
