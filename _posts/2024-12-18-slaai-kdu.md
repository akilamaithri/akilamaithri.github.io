## Gestation of AI
* Turing Thesis (1936): Established the concept of computability with six primitives: READ, WRITE, LEFT, RIGHT, DELETE and DO NOTHING to computarize any task.
* Turing's Seminal Paper (1952): "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" laid the groundwork for modern AI.
* John McCarthy's Proposal (1956): Introduced "Artificial Intelligence" as a distrinct field for intelligent machines. [Proposal ðŸ”—](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/1904/1802.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1aBvZ8ztOoWU6rQPgbi84QM&scisig=AFWwaebHpvxxagcd_mk07SZghvit&oi=scholarr)
* Objectives of AI: To understand natural intelligence and build intelligence into machines - AI is the science and engineering of constructing intelligent machines
* Turing's Impact: Positioned AI as a software engineering challenge.
* Neuroscience foundation: AI Draws from neuroscience to explore broad areas of intelligence logic-based and training based- symbolic and non-symbolic AI.
* Human Evolution: Highlighted the role of symbolic manipulation in humanity's rapid advancement compared to other species. 

## Triune of the Brain
1. Mammal (Peleopallium) - Emotion, Seek Pleasure, Avoid Pain
2. Reptile (Archipallium) - Survival, Fear
3. Rational (Neopallium) - Logic and thinking

## Intelligence

* Evolution from Symbolic to Non-Symbolic AI: Transition from Knowledge-driven rule-based systems to data-driven machine learning models
* LLMs: Blended symbolic and non-symbolic AI to enable creative synergy.
* Unique Nature of AI: Combines power with control, leading to autonomous decision-making and implications for singularity.
* Outperforming Human Limitations: AI surpasses humans in situations like,
  * Access time
  * Fatigue, base,
* AI can solve any problem: This is an implication of the Turing Thesis.

## Singularity
* Achievements of AI: Surpassed expectations, with machines now exceeding human intelligence in various domains.
* Turing Test Revisited: AI's ability to "fool the interrogator" is now a reality in many AI solutions - this happens if the interrogator is less knowledgeable about a subject matter. 
* Impacts of Generative AI: Reduces the need for human cognitive skills such as 
  * Reading Comprehension, Thinking, Retention, Problem-Solving, Imagination, Communication, Creativity etc.
* Cognitive Risks: Humanity risks losing hard-earned cognitive capabilities developed over millennia.
* Acknowledging Risks. Growing awareness of the challenges and dangers associated with singularity. 

## Facing Singularity
* Human-Centered AI: Ensures that AI systems are designed with human needs and values at the core - human involvement of final decision making by AI systems.
* Explainable AI: AI systems go beyond just giving answers, but are able to explain the reasons for the answers - ML solutions still suffer from this issue.
* Responsible AI: Focuses on the ethical, social and legal aspects of AI to mitigate risks.
* Tools for cognitive enhancement: develop AI tools to boost cognitive skills such as memory, thinking, language skills and problem-solving skills with humans.
* Biological Programming: Programming biological system beyond machines modification at the genetic level.
* Mind Uploading
* Humanity as Cyborgs: Envisions integration of AI with human biology to augment capabilities and address singularity concerns.

### Keynote by Prof Emi Yuda

Japan is facing a super-aging society and there is an urgent need to solve problems in traffic safety technology. She presented their latest research on **driver biological condition** monitoring technology using **bio-signal processing and machine learning**.

* Analysis method for sitting pressure
   1. Pressure distribution mapping (Image processing method)
   2. Time Series Analysis
   3. Frequency Analysis

* Summary
  * Heart rate variability analysis is useful and particularly excellent for **screening** for heard disease and sleep disorders.
  * However, conventional methods for **estimating fatigue** and **sleepiness** using autonomic estimation methods are not sufficient.
  * They proposed a new analysis method based on sitting pressure analysis which visualized the change in sitting pressure balance over time during a 240 minute sitting simulation operation.
